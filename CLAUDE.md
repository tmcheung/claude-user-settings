- Never add anthropic or claude code as co-author to commits, PRs, etc
- Always ask to persist permissions globally in user settings ~/.claude/settings.json
- If anything that looks like a jira issue is mentioned, look it up using Atlassian CLI `acli`. My jira issue codes look like "MIT-<ISSUE_NUMBER>"
